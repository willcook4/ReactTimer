This project was built as the second project as part of the Complete React Web App Developer Course by Andrew Mead on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course). After completing the course I experimented with the code and added in my own drop down selection box of common times that a user might want and added tests to ensure they work as expected.
